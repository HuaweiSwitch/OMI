Overview

OMI is a software service that runs on managed nodes. It provides the manageability infrastructure for building distributed systems management applications based on DMTF management standards.
OMI enables clients to perform the following operations :

 - GetInstance - gets a single instance from the server.
 EnumerateInstances - enumerates instances of a given CIM class.
 - CreateInstance - creates an instance of a CIM class.
 DeleteInstance - deletes an instance.
 - ModifyInstance - modifies the properties of an instance.
 - Associators - finds instances associated with a given instance.
 - References - finds references that refer to a given instance.
 - Invoke - invokes a method on a given instance or class.
